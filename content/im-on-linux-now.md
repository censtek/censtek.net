At least for now. 

As nobody has seen bc why would anyone be constantly checking the GitHub repo for this site, I updated the [Software I use](/software) post on this website to now say that I am running Pop!_OS (it's a retarded name ik) on my PC

I'm going to try my best to stick with using Linux as long as possible since I think learning more about Linux will be a good thing for me. I chose Pop OS mainly bc I like the UI of it and the NVIDIA integration is nice. Although the process of choosing a distro took me a while but so far I'm liking Pop OS and plan to stick with it until there comes a reason as to why I need to switch.
