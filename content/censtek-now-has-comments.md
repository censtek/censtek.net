Yep! This website now has a comment section! So you can tell me how awesome I am or how you want to see my corpse hanging off a tree! Send whatever feedback you would like!

With the service I'm using, the comments have to be manually approved by me but I won't be a faggot jannie and I'll just let them all go through (unless it's like straight up illegal shit). As far as I'm aware there's no way for me to have it auto accept all comments so I'll just do it myself. If that gets me banned from Cusdis, I'll self host my own instance and then I'll be unstoppable! Open source is great :)
