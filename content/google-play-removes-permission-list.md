If you want a more in depth look at this, I'd recommend watching this video by Mental Outlaw if you don't want to hear my retarded autistic ass give a take on it

So Google in their infinite wisdom decided that it would remove the permissions list that they've had for years on the Google Play Store and put the burden of that onto the developers themselves. They are trying to rip off Apple's App Privacy section introduced in iOS 14 which is pictured below

The issue with this approach is that developers can (and probably will) easily lie about what kind of data their apps collect and make it seem like it collects as minimal amounts of data possible when that really isn't the case.

Also nobody should be suprised that no Meta owned app has submitted this information yet. (and probably won't until they are 100% required to)

And also the information given is very vague too. Like for example looking at Telegram's Data Safety Section, it tells you that the data is "encrypted in transit" so the user would probably assume it was E2E encrypted but for Telegram that is not the case

If you are too retarded to have figured this out already, Google doesn't give a fuck about your privacy. Neither does really all of big tech. At the end of the day, it's all a grift.

# UPDATE
As of July 21st 2022, Google has rolled back this decision and will restore the permissions list
