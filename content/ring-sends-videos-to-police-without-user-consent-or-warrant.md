At this point, this is what you should be expecting from big tech companies like Amazon (in this case), Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. This whole concept of giving law enforcement data without a warrant or user consent is not a new practice. Emergency Data Requests (I'll call them EDRs for short) have been a thing with some companies for a bit now where law enforcement could submit an EDR and the company would give law enforcement data they requested if they complied with EDRs. This whole process could be done without a warrant and is supposed to be meant for very serious situations like if someone is at risk of dying. But this has been abused by hackers before who have impersonated law enforcement to trick big tech companies to giving them data. You can read more on that [here](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of-subpoena-via-fake-emergency-data-requests/) or watch this video segment clipped from [this video](https://odysee.com/@surveillancereport:2/threema-just-got-better!-surveillance:9) to get a brief summary of what happened

So it shouldn't be suprising to learn that Amazon owned Ring has finally admitted to doing this practice, but only after doing it 11 times this year (that they've admitted to) without telling us first. Gotta love the big tech transparency! You don't own your data if it's on a server that you don't control. As nice as it would be to be able to buy a Ring doorbell and be able to use your own servers that only you have access to, that's too much ownership for the consumer in the eyes of big tech. Since that data is sitting on Amazon's server, they can do whatever the fuck they want with it really. I won't be suprised if this will also be abused by hackers like the EDRs I mentioned earlier were. I guess we'll have to wait and see.

If you want a good video going over this situation, Mental Outlaw made a good one
