Twitter's growing incompetence has gotten to the point where they themselves are recommending that you don't give them personal information since they can't trust themselves to keep that information safe! Despite the fact that Twitter will randomly lock you out of your account if you don't have a phone number linked bc they think you are a "bot" and the only way to get back in is to verify a phone number, they are saying to not give them personal information!

If you didn't read [this blog post](/5-million-twitter-accounts-breached/) about Twitter's security incident, I would suggest reading that since that is the incident that is in question here.

This is just a short blog post to laugh at Twitter's shocking amount of incompetence. You would think a company that has a platform as relevant as Twitter would know how to actually properly run a social media platform, but they seem to have some magical power to fuck up everything they do.
