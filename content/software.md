At the moment, I am using [Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS](https://pop.system76.com/) on my PC,

On my phone, I am using [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) on my Google Pixel 4a.

For my web browser I am using [Brave Browser](https://brave.com) with [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) and [Decentraleyes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decentraleyes/ldpochfccmkkmhdbclfhpagapcfdljkj) since Brave's built in ad blocker is kinda shit. 

My preferred chat app is [Signal](https://signal.org)for people (irls) I feel comfortable giving my phone number to (signal plz plz plz add usernames) and [Telegram](https://telegram.org) for the people that I don't feel comfortable giving my phone number to. If Signal had usernames then I'd just use it for everybody.

I use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) for my password manager and I paid the $10 for a year of Premium so I could have my TOTP 2FA codes in Bitwarden and not have to use a seperate app. Although if I want to, I could just self host [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) instead of using Bitwarden's servers and get that feature for free but I paid more for the convenience and it's not like $10 for a year of Premium is expensive anyways.

For my VPN, I use [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com) and I have the Pro version for a year. I mainly just use Windscribe so I can torrent safely. VPNs aren't some magical tool that will make you 100% private just bc you are using a VPN and if you still believe that, check out this video about what VPNs are good for and what they are not good for (VPN advertising is very misleading)

One thing to note about Windscribe however was there was an incident in 2021 where Ukrainian police seized their servers and were able to decrypt the data from that server due to there being out of date software on that server with a vulnerability that allowed for the data to be decrypted. This segment from [this video](https://odysee.com/@techlore:3/windscribe-vpn-servers-seized-!:b?r=HYdzmHznN8wkQ8WapW2qynxf917RCYqu) explains it pretty well.

For downloading stuff, I use [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) for torrenting and [Free Download Manager](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/) for (usually) downloading large files from websites.

For my Minecraft launcher, I use [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/) instead of the official MC launcher since PolyMC is open source

For podcast listening, I use [GNOME Podcasts](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Podcasts) on my PC and [AntennaPod](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod/) on my phone
