First let me admit something that I am shameful about, I am still a Windows cuck. But, I have taken some steps to mitigate some of Microsoft's bullshit. 

![Windows System Info Screenshot](/wininfo.png)

I am currently using Windows 10 IoT LTSC 2021 which is an official version of Windows 10 from Microsoft that has an extended support date from the consumer version, and also gets rid of a ton of the microsoft bloat. I uploaded the ISO [here](https://odysee.com/windows10-ltsc-iot-2021:4f9fb26777c1c62dc2db9118e28fc25ba1b8c1af?r=HYdzmHznN8wkQ8WapW2qynxf917RCYqu) and you can use [this script](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts) to activate it. I also used [ShutUp10](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10) to disable more of the telemetry that you couldn't disable at the setup.

On my phone, I am using [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) on my Google Pixel 4a.

For my web browser I am using [Brave Browser](https://brave.com) with [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) and [Decentraleyes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decentraleyes/ldpochfccmkkmhdbclfhpagapcfdljkj) since Brave's built in ad blocker is kinda shit. 

My preferred chat app is [Signal](https://signal.org) for people (irls) I feel comfortable giving my phone number to (signal plz plz plz add usernames) and [Telegram](https://telegram.org) for the people that I don't feel comfortable giving my phone number to. If Signal had usernames then I'd just use it for everybody.

I use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) for my password manager and I paid the $10 for a year of Premium so I could have my TOTP 2FA codes in Bitwarden and not have to use a seperate app. Although if I want to, I could just self host [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) instead of using Bitwarden's servers and get that feature for free but I paid more for the convenience and it's not like $10 for a year of Premium is expensive anyways.

For my VPN, I use [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com) and I have the Pro version for a year. I mainly just use Windscribe so I can torrent safely. VPNs aren't some magical tool that will make you 100% private just bc you are using a VPN and if you still believe that, check out this video about what VPNs are good for and what they are not good for (VPN advertising is very misleading)

One thing to note about Windscribe however was there was an incident in 2021 where Ukrainian police seized their servers and were able to decrypt the data from that server due to there being out of date software on that server with a vulnerability that allowed for the data to be decrypted. This segment from [this video](https://odysee.com/@techlore:3/windscribe-vpn-servers-seized-!:b?r=HYdzmHznN8wkQ8WapW2qynxf917RCYqu) explains it pretty well.

For downloading stuff, I use [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) for torrenting and [Free Download Manager](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/) for (usually) downloading large files from websites.

For my video player, I use [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) and for my image viewer, I use [ImageGlass](https://imageglass.org/) (since Windows 10 LTSC doesn't come with a video player other then the old ass one from Windows 7 and also it doesn't have a photo viewer and photos just open in MS Paint by default lol)

For my Minecraft launcher, I use [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/) instead of the official MC launcher since PolyMC is open source
