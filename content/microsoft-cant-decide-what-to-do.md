For the past couple months, Microsoft has been visibily unsure on what their final decision is with blocking macros or not by default in office.

In case you aren't aware, macros in Microsoft office has been used as a (pretty effective) attack vector for running malicious code on a victims PC.

If you want a example of this being abused by hackers, I'd recommend giving this video a watch

Back in Feburary, Microsoft announced that they were going to get rid of the ability to enable macros from untrusted files you've downloaded from the internet

This was a good change. This would help defeat the issue of malicious macros and wouldn't affect too many people since the legit use of legacy macros was becoming smaller and smaller while the malicious abuse of it was on the rise.

Then for some reason, Microsoft decided to roll back this decision based on unspecified "feedback" from an unspecified amount of people.

This was a pretty unpopular decision on Microsoft's part, especially from the cybersecurity community.

Then a couple days later, they reversed their reversal on blocking the macros by default? It's laughable how clueless Microsoft looks about what they want to do here.

Now it looks like they are trying to double down on this and it looks like the rollout blocking the macros has resumed. But we'll see if they change it again like a mentally challenged child.
