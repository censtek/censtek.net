<p>So Google in their infinite wisdom decided that it would remove the permissions list that they&rsquo;ve had for years on the Google Play Store and put the burden of that onto the developers themselves. They are trying to rip off Apple&rsquo;s App Privacy section introduced in iOS 14 which is pictured below</p>

<p>The issue with this approach is that developers can (and probably will) easily lie about what kind of data their apps collect and make it seem like it collects as minimal amounts of data possible when that really isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>Also nobody should be suprised that no Meta owned app has submitted this information yet. (and probably won&rsquo;t until they are 100% required to)</p>

<img src="/igdata.png" alt="Instagram Data Safety Section">
<img src="/mdata.png" alt="Facebook Messenger Data Safety Section"></p>
<p>And also the information given is very vague too. Like for example looking at Telegram&rsquo;s Data Safety Section, it tells you that the data is &ldquo;encrypted in transit&rdquo; so the user would probably assume it was E2E encrypted but for Telegram that is not the case

<p>If you are too retarded to have figured this out already, Google doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck about your privacy. Neither does really all of big tech. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all a grift.</p>
<h1 id="update">UPDATE</h1>
<p>As of July 21st 2022, Google has rolled back this decision and will restore the permissions list</p>
