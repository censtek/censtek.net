		<description>&lt;p&gt;At least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As nobody has seen bc why would anyone be constantly checking the GitHub repo for this site, I updated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://censtek.net/software&#34;&gt;Software I use&lt;/a&gt; post on this website to now say that I am running Pop!_OS (it&amp;rsquo;s a retarded name ik) on my PC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://censtek.net/softwarepostupdate.png&#34; alt=&#34;GitHub commit updating the post&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to try my best to stick with using Linux as long as possible since I think learning more about Linux will be a good thing for me. I chose Pop OS mainly bc I like the UI of it and the NVIDIA integration is nice. Although the process of choosing a distro took me a while but so far I&amp;rsquo;m liking Pop OS and plan to stick with it until there comes a reason as to why I need to switch.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Ring Sends Videos to Police Without User Consent or Warrant</title>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;At this point, this is what you should be expecting from big tech companies like Amazon (in this case), Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. This whole concept of giving law enforcement data without a warrant or user consent is not a new practice. Emergency Data Requests (I&amp;rsquo;ll call them EDRs for short) have been a thing with some companies for a bit now where law enforcement could submit an EDR and the company would give law enforcement data they requested if they complied with EDRs. This whole process could be done without a warrant and is supposed to be meant for very serious situations like if someone is at risk of dying. But this has been abused by hackers before who have impersonated law enforcement to trick big tech companies to giving them data. You can read more on that &lt;a href=&#34;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of-subpoena-via-fake-emergency-data-requests/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or watch this video segment clipped from &lt;a href=&#34;https://odysee.com/@surveillancereport:2/threema-just-got-better!-surveillance:9&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; to get a brief summary of what happened&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe id=&#34;lbry-iframe&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://odysee.com/$/embed/edrabusesegment/445f5ae61ae1ad9c1c3b632eebe18d30e932ff62?&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be suprising to learn that Amazon owned Ring has finally admitted to doing this practice, but only after doing it 11 times this year (that they&amp;rsquo;ve admitted to) without telling us first. Gotta love the big tech transparency! You don&amp;rsquo;t own your data if it&amp;rsquo;s on a server that you don&amp;rsquo;t control. As nice as it would be to be able to buy a Ring doorbell and be able to use your own servers that only you have access to, that&amp;rsquo;s too much ownership for the consumer in the eyes of big tech. Since that data is sitting on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s server, they can do whatever the fuck they want with it really. I won&amp;rsquo;t be suprised if this will also be abused by hackers like the EDRs I mentioned earlier were. I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a good video going over this situation, Mental Outlaw made a good one&lt;/p&gt;
