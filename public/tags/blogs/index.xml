		<title>5 Million Twitter Accounts And Their Information Breached And Up For Sale</title>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;This is just another situation showing that no company is invincible to security incidents, no matter how big and how much money they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitch (owned by Amazon) had literally all the source code for the entire website leaked back in October 2021, Facebook had a data breach in April of 2021 that exposed 530 million accounts, and theres many more examples of this stuff happening to massive tech companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Twitter just had one of the newest big tech breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://mstdn.social/@censtek/108693422558957121/embed&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;270&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the hacker has been holding onto this data since December 2021, and has been holding onto it even after Twitter has patched the exploit they used to get the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;In a conversation with the threat actor, BleepingComputer was told that they used a vulnerability to collect the data in December 2021. They are now selling the data for $30,000, and that interested buyers have already approached them.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;The vulnerability allows any party without any authentication to obtain a twitter ID (which is almost equal to getting the username of an account) of any user by submitting a phone number/email even though the user has prohibitted this action in the privacy settings,&amp;quot; reads the vulnerability disclosure by security researcher &#39;zhirinovskiy.&#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;The bug exists due to the proccess of authorization used in the Android Client of Twitter, specifically in the procces of checking the duplication of a Twitter account.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;The hacker told us that you could feed email addresses and phone numbers to the vulnerability to determine if it is associated with a Twitter account and retrieve that account&#39;s ID.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;sourcehttpswwwbleepingcomputercomnewssecurityhacker-selling-twitter-account-data-of-54-million-users-for-30k&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-selling-twitter-account-data-of-54-million-users-for-30k/&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the hacker, they have nothing to do with HackOne or the security researcher who disclosed the exploit to Twitter.
The exploit was reported to Twitter on January 1st and was fixed by Twitter on January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter has told BleepingComputer that they are investigating the breach but have not confirmed it yet. But using the small sample size that the hacker gave BleepingComputer, they confirmed with the people in the sample they were given that the information they were given was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Twitter has not confirmed the data breach at this time, telling BleepingComputer that they are investigating the authenticity of the claims.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;However, BleepingComputer verified with some of the Twitter users listed in a small sample of data shared by the hacker that the private information (email addresses and phone numbers) is accurate.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;sourcehttpswwwbleepingcomputercomnewssecurityhacker-selling-twitter-account-data-of-54-million-users-for-30k-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-selling-twitter-account-data-of-54-million-users-for-30k/&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always with data breaches, make sure to change your password if you are affected (and even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know if you are or not, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to change it anyways to be safe) and make sure to be checking emails you get and carefully make sure they aren&amp;rsquo;t phishing emails.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Microsoft Cant Decide What to Do With Office Macros</title>
		<link>https://censtek.net/microsoft-cant-decide-what-to-do/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 17:29:03 -0400</pubDate>
		
		<guid>https://censtek.net/microsoft-cant-decide-what-to-do/</guid>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;For the past couple months, Microsoft has been visibily unsure on what their final decision is with blocking macros or not by default in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you aren&amp;rsquo;t aware, macros in Microsoft office has been used as a (pretty effective) attack vector for running malicious code on a victims PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a example of this being abused by hackers, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend giving this video a watch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe id=&#34;odysee-iframe&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://odysee.com/$/embed/hacked-by-a-spreadsheet/3b70eab8a2246840bee3014ebb231a8826ed3a1d?r=HYdzmHznN8wkQ8WapW2qynxf917RCYqu&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Back in Feburary, Microsoft announced that they were going to get rid of the ability to enable macros from untrusted files you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded from the internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://freeradical.zone/@thenewoil/107765095472642429/embed&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;270&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a good change. This would help defeat the issue of malicious macros and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t affect too many people since the legit use of legacy macros was becoming smaller and smaller while the malicious abuse of it was on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then for some reason, Microsoft decided to roll back this decision based on unspecified &amp;ldquo;feedback&amp;rdquo; from an unspecified amount of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://freeradical.zone/@thenewoil/108614102705942324/embed&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;270&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty unpopular decision on Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s part, especially from the cybersecurity community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a couple days later, they reversed their reversal on blocking the macros by default? It&amp;rsquo;s laughable how clueless Microsoft looks about what they want to do here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://freeradical.zone/@thenewoil/108635084526878264/embed&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;270&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it looks like they are trying to double down on this and it looks like the rollout blocking the macros has resumed. But we&amp;rsquo;ll see if they change it again like a mentally challenged child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://freeradical.zone/@thenewoil/108691598226786655/embed&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;270&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

		<title>Google Play removes the permission lists from apps, putting the responsibility of disclosing them to the app devs (UPDATED)</title>
		<link>https://censtek.net/google-play-removes-permission-list/</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 18:27:08 -0400</pubDate>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;If you want a more in depth look at this, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend watching this video by Mental Outlaw if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear my retarded autistic ass give a take on it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe id=&#34;odysee-iframe&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://odysee.com/$/embed/google%27s-data-safety-section-removes-app/a4e6a9746fe06ef7421432fab16930c3c48853d4?r=HYdzmHznN8wkQ8WapW2qynxf917RCYqu&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Google in their infinite wisdom decided that it would remove the permissions list that they&amp;rsquo;ve had for years on the Google Play Store and put the burden of that onto the developers themselves. They are trying to rip off Apple&amp;rsquo;s App Privacy section introduced in iOS 14 which is pictured below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://censtek.net/appleappprivacy.png&#34; alt=&#34;Apple&amp;rsquo;s App Privacy Section&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with this approach is that developers can (and probably will) easily lie about what kind of data their apps collect and make it seem like it collects as minimal amounts of data possible when that really isn&amp;rsquo;t the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also nobody should be suprised that no Meta owned app has submitted this information yet. (and probably won&amp;rsquo;t until they are 100% required to)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://censtek.net/wadata.png&#34; alt=&#34;WhatsApp Data Safety Section&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://censtek.net/fbdata.png&#34; alt=&#34;Facebook Data Safety Section&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://censtek.net/igdata.png&#34; alt=&#34;Instagram Data Safety Section&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://censtek.net/mdata.png&#34; alt=&#34;Facebook Messenger Data Safety Section&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also the information given is very vague too. Like for example looking at Telegram&amp;rsquo;s Data Safety Section, it tells you that the data is &amp;ldquo;encrypted in transit&amp;rdquo; so the user would probably assume it was E2E encrypted but for Telegram that is not the case
&lt;img src=&#34;https://censtek.net/tgdatasnippet.png&#34; alt=&#34;Telegram Data Safety Section&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are too retarded to have figured this out already, Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t give a fuck about your privacy. Neither does really all of big tech. At the end of the day, it&amp;rsquo;s all a grift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of July 21st 2022, Google has rolled back this decision and will restore the permissions list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://mstdn.social/@censtek/108685962594532468/embed&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;270&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

		<title>I&#39;m using Linux now!</title>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;At least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As nobody has seen bc why would anyone be constantly checking the GitHub repo for this site, I updated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://censtek.net/software&#34;&gt;Software I use&lt;/a&gt; post on this website to now say that I am running Pop!_OS (it&amp;rsquo;s a retarded name ik) on my PC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://censtek.net/softwarepostupdate.png&#34; alt=&#34;GitHub commit updating the post&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to try my best to stick with using Linux as long as possible since I think learning more about Linux will be a good thing for me. I chose Pop OS mainly bc I like the UI of it and the NVIDIA integration is nice. Although the process of choosing a distro took me a while but so far I&amp;rsquo;m liking Pop OS and plan to stick with it until there comes a reason as to why I need to switch.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Ring Sends Videos to Police Without User Consent or Warrant</title>
		<link>https://censtek.net/ring-sends-videos-to-police-without-user-consent-or-warrant/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 17:10:34 -0400</pubDate>
		
		<guid>https://censtek.net/ring-sends-videos-to-police-without-user-consent-or-warrant/</guid>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;At this point, this is what you should be expecting from big tech companies like Amazon (in this case), Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. This whole concept of giving law enforcement data without a warrant or user consent is not a new practice. Emergency Data Requests (I&amp;rsquo;ll call them EDRs for short) have been a thing with some companies for a bit now where law enforcement could submit an EDR and the company would give law enforcement data they requested if they complied with EDRs. This whole process could be done without a warrant and is supposed to be meant for very serious situations like if someone is at risk of dying. But this has been abused by hackers before who have impersonated law enforcement to trick big tech companies to giving them data. You can read more on that &lt;a href=&#34;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of-subpoena-via-fake-emergency-data-requests/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or watch this video segment clipped from &lt;a href=&#34;https://odysee.com/@surveillancereport:2/threema-just-got-better!-surveillance:9&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; to get a brief summary of what happened&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe id=&#34;lbry-iframe&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://odysee.com/$/embed/edrabusesegment/445f5ae61ae1ad9c1c3b632eebe18d30e932ff62?&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be suprising to learn that Amazon owned Ring has finally admitted to doing this practice, but only after doing it 11 times this year (that they&amp;rsquo;ve admitted to) without telling us first. Gotta love the big tech transparency! You don&amp;rsquo;t own your data if it&amp;rsquo;s on a server that you don&amp;rsquo;t control. As nice as it would be to be able to buy a Ring doorbell and be able to use your own servers that only you have access to, that&amp;rsquo;s too much ownership for the consumer in the eyes of big tech. Since that data is sitting on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s server, they can do whatever the fuck they want with it really. I won&amp;rsquo;t be suprised if this will also be abused by hackers like the EDRs I mentioned earlier were. I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a good video going over this situation, Mental Outlaw made a good one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
