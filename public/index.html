</h3>
<h5>It looks like the dreaded change that nobody is a fan of has finally been implemented into Minecraft Java Edition. If you aren&rsquo;t caught up to speed, when Minecraft 1.19 was released, Mojang added a cryptographic key to each chat message sent in a server of realm to make it so that the chat message is cryptographically linked to the player that sent it. Then in a snapshot build, Mojang added a chat report feature where in any server, you could report a player&rsquo;s chat message under one of the categories shown below (although the profanity option was removed in a later build).</h5>

In case you aren&rsquo;t aware, macros in Microsoft office has been used as a (pretty effective) attack vector for running malicious code on a victims PC.
If you want a example of this being abused by hackers, I&rsquo;d recommend giving this video a watch
   Back in Feburary, Microsoft announced that they were going to get rid of the ability to enable macros from untrusted files you&rsquo;ve downloaded from the internet</h5>

<h5>Yep! This website now has a comment section! So you can tell me how awesome I am or how you want to see my corpse hanging off a tree! Send whatever feedback you would like!
With the service I&rsquo;m using, the comments have to be manually approved by me but I won&rsquo;t be a faggot jannie and I&rsquo;ll just let them all go through (unless it&rsquo;s like straight up illegal shit).</h5>
