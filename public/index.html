<li>July 17, 2022 - <a href="/google-play-removes-permission-list/">Google Play removes the permission lists from apps, putting the responsibility of disclosing them to the app devs (UPDATED)</a></li>
</h3>
<h5>If you want a more in depth look at this, I&rsquo;d recommend watching this video by Mental Outlaw if you don&rsquo;t want to hear my retarded autistic ass give a take on it
   So Google in their infinite wisdom decided that it would remove the permissions list that they&rsquo;ve had for years on the Google Play Store and put the burden of that onto the developers themselves. They are trying to rip off Apple&rsquo;s App Privacy section introduced in iOS 14 which is pictured below</h5>

<li>July 17, 2022 - <a href="/im-on-linux-now/">I&#39;m using Linux now!</a></li>
</h3>
<h5>At least for now.
As nobody has seen bc why would anyone be constantly checking the GitHub repo for this site, I updated the Software I use post on this website to now say that I am running Pop!_OS (it&rsquo;s a retarded name ik) on my PC
I&rsquo;m going to try my best to stick with using Linux as long as possible since I think learning more about Linux will be a good thing for me.</h5>

<li>July 15, 2022 - <a href="/ring-sends-videos-to-police-without-user-consent-or-warrant/">Ring Sends Videos to Police Without User Consent or Warrant</a></li>
</h3>
<h5>At this point, this is what you should be expecting from big tech companies like Amazon (in this case), Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. This whole concept of giving law enforcement data without a warrant or user consent is not a new practice. Emergency Data Requests (I&rsquo;ll call them EDRs for short) have been a thing with some companies for a bit now where law enforcement could submit an EDR and the company would give law enforcement data they requested if they complied with EDRs.</h5>
