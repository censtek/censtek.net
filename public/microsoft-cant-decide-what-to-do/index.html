<p>For the past couple months, Microsoft has been visibily unsure on what their final decision is with blocking macros or not by default in office.</p>
<p>In case you aren&rsquo;t aware, macros in Microsoft office has been used as a (pretty effective) attack vector for running malicious code on a victims PC.</p>

<p>Back in Feburary, Microsoft announced that they were going to get rid of the ability to enable macros from untrusted files you&rsquo;ve downloaded from the internet</p>

<p>This was a good change. This would help defeat the issue of malicious macros and wouldn&rsquo;t affect too many people since the legit use of legacy macros was becoming smaller and smaller while the malicious abuse of it was on the rise.</p>
<p>Then for some reason, Microsoft decided to roll back this decision based on unspecified &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; from an unspecified amount of people.</p>
<iframe src="https://freeradical.zone/@thenewoil/108614102705942324/embed" width="100%" height="270"></iframe>
<p>This was a pretty unpopular decision on Microsoft&rsquo;s part, especially from the cybersecurity community.</p>
<p>Then a couple days later, they reversed their reversal on blocking the macros by default? It&rsquo;s laughable how clueless Microsoft looks about what they want to do here.</p>

<p>Now it looks like they are trying to double down on this and it looks like the rollout blocking the macros has resumed. But we&rsquo;ll see if they change it again like a mentally challenged child.</p>
