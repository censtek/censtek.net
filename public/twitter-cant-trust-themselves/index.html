<p>Twitter&rsquo;s growing incompetence has gotten to the point where they themselves are recommending that you don&rsquo;t give them personal information since they can&rsquo;t trust themselves to keep that information safe! Despite the fact that Twitter will randomly lock you out of your account if you don&rsquo;t have a phone number linked bc they think you are a &ldquo;bot&rdquo; and the only way to get back in is to verify a phone number, they are saying to not give them personal information!</p>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t read <a href="/5-million-twitter-accounts-breached/">this blog post</a> about Twitter&rsquo;s security incident, I would suggest reading that since that is the incident that is in question here.</p>
<p>This is just a short blog post to laugh at Twitter&rsquo;s shocking amount of incompetence. You would think a company that has a platform as relevant as Twitter would know how to actually properly run a social media platform, but they seem to have some magical power to fuck up everything they do.</p>
