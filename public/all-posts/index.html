<h5>At this point, this is what you should be expecting from big tech companies like Amazon (in this case), Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. This whole concept of giving law enforcement data without a warrant or user consent is not a new practice.

<h5>At the moment, I am using Pop!_OS on my PC,
On my phone, I am using CalyxOS on my Google Pixel 4a.
For my web browser I am using Brave Browser with uBlock Origin and Decentraleyes since Brave&rsquo;s built in ad blocker is kinda shit.
My preferred chat app is Signal for people (irls) I feel comfortable giving my phone number to (signal plz plz plz add usernames) and Telegram for the people that I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable giving my phone number to.</h5>
