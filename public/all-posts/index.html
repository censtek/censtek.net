</h3>
<h5>It looks like the dreaded change that nobody is a fan of has finally been implemented into Minecraft Java Edition. If you aren&rsquo;t caught up to speed, when Minecraft 1.19 was released, Mojang added a cryptographic key to each chat message sent in a server of realm to make it so that the chat message is cryptographically linked to the player that sent it. Then in a snapshot build, Mojang added a chat report feature where in any server, you could report a player&rsquo;s chat message under one of the categories shown below (although the profanity option was removed in a later build).</h5>

</h3>
<h5>This is just another situation showing that no company is invincible to security incidents, no matter how big and how much money they have.
Twitch (owned by Amazon) had literally all the source code for the entire website leaked back in October 2021, Facebook had a data breach in April of 2021 that exposed 530 million accounts, and theres many more examples of this stuff happening to massive tech companies</h5>

</h3>
<h5>For the past couple months, Microsoft has been visibily unsure on what their final decision is with blocking macros or not by default in office.
In case you aren&rsquo;t aware, macros in Microsoft office has been used as a (pretty effective) attack vector for running malicious code on a victims PC.
If you want a example of this being abused by hackers, I&rsquo;d recommend giving this video a watch
   Back in Feburary, Microsoft announced that they were going to get rid of the ability to enable macros from untrusted files you&rsquo;ve downloaded from the internet</h5>

<h5>Yep! This website now has a comment section! So you can tell me how awesome I am or how you want to see my corpse hanging off a tree! Send whatever feedback you would like!
With the service I&rsquo;m using, the comments have to be manually approved by me but I won&rsquo;t be a faggot jannie and I&rsquo;ll just let them all go through (unless it&rsquo;s like straight up illegal shit).</h5>

<li>July 17, 2022 - <a href="/google-play-removes-permission-list/">Google Play removes the permission lists from apps, putting the responsibility of disclosing them to the app devs (UPDATED)</a></li>
</h3>
<h5>If you want a more in depth look at this, I&rsquo;d recommend watching this video by Mental Outlaw if you don&rsquo;t want to hear my retarded autistic ass give a take on it
   So Google in their infinite wisdom decided that it would remove the permissions list that they&rsquo;ve had for years on the Google Play Store and put the burden of that onto the developers themselves. They are trying to rip off Apple&rsquo;s App Privacy section introduced in iOS 14 which is pictured below</h5>

<h5>At least for now.
As nobody has seen bc why would anyone be constantly checking the GitHub repo for this site, I updated the Software I use post on this website to now say that I am running Pop!_OS (it&rsquo;s a retarded name ik) on my PC
I&rsquo;m going to try my best to stick with using Linux as long as possible since I think learning more about Linux will be a good thing for me.</h5>

</h3>
<h5>At this point, this is what you should be expecting from big tech companies like Amazon (in this case), Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. This whole concept of giving law enforcement data without a warrant or user consent is not a new practice. Emergency Data Requests (I&rsquo;ll call them EDRs for short) have been a thing with some companies for a bit now where law enforcement could submit an EDR and the company would give law enforcement data they requested if they complied with EDRs.</h5>
